# Question
What is a "shallow" clone, and why can it cause bugs?

# Answer
A shallow clone is a copy of the original array or object. If we accidentally call the wrong copy then our code can produce the wrong results.

# Teacher Feedback

Basically a shallow clone is a copy of only the primitive data types so that means that the other info is still being passed by reference making it mutable!
