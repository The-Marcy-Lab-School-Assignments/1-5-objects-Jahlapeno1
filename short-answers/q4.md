# Question
Watch this (10 minute video on JSON)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM].

What is JSON? Why isn't the example below valid JSON?

```js
{
  name: "Zo",
  isCool: true,
  age: 28
}
```

# Answer
JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a way of representing data that is easy for people to read and write while also being easy for machines to generate. The example is not valid because the kays of the object need to be in quotation marks.

Here is the fixed version.

```js
{
  "name": "Zo",
  "isCool": true,
  "age": 28
}
