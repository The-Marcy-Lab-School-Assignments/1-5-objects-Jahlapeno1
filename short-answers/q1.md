# Question
When would be a good time to use an array instead of an object, and vice versa? Please provide examples.

# Answer
An array would be beneficial when the order of the data being stored matters. For example, if I wanted to organize information of the hours in a day I would make an array like this.

```js
const day = ['hour0', 'hour1', 'hour2' ]
```

An object would be better if we want to read the properties instead of referring to the index.

```js
const dog = {
    age : 7,
    breed : 'Chow-Chow'
}
