# Question
What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer
Pass by value and pass by reference are how arguments are passed in a function. Pass by value copies the value and whatever changes made to it in the function don't effect the original value. For pass by reference the function receives a reference to whatever value is in its memory. This means that whatever changes made to it are saved making it mutable.

Yup! Small add-on, primitive data types are passed by value and non-primitive data types are passed by reference.
